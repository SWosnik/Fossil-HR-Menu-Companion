# Fossil-HR-Menu-Companion
Companion app for the Fossil HR advanced menu

## How to use

Please make sure to use at least GB Version INSERT_VERSION_HERE.

When you send the send floating button, the menu gets temporarily sent to the watch.
In that state, it will not survive a watch crash/reboot.

Yet, GB will remember the menu structure. To persistently embed the structure in the watchface,
create a new watchface in GB, GB will then inject the structure json into the new watchface.
